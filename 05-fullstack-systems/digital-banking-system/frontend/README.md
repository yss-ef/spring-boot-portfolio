## Key Features

* **Authentication & Security:** Secure login workflow via **JWT**, strict Role-Based Access Control (Admin/User), and protected routing using Angular Route Guards.
* **Administrative Dashboard:** A comprehensive overview featuring Key Performance Indicators (Total clients, accounts, total assets) and interactive charts detailing account distribution and balances.
* **Customer Management:** Real-time search capabilities alongside full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for client profiles.
* **Account Management:** Native interface support for **Current Accounts** (handling overdrafts) and **Saving Accounts** (handling interest rates).
* **Financial Operations:** Dedicated interfaces for consulting paginated transaction histories and executing secure account-to-account transfers.

## System Architecture

The project adopts a **Modern Angular Architecture**, heavily prioritizing modularity, ease of maintenance, and rendering performance.

## Technical Analysis

### Interactive Dashboard (Chart.js)

The administrator dashboard leverages **Chart.js** to transform raw banking data into visual intelligence. It features:

* **KPI Cards:** Rapid insights into core metrics.
* **Doughnut Charts:** Visualizing the proportional distribution of account types (Current vs. Savings).
* **Bar Charts:** Comparing total financial assets locked within different account categories.

### Client-Side Role-Based Security

The user interface dynamically adapts based on the roles extracted and decoded directly from the JWT payload:

* The **Dashboard** navigation link is strictly rendered only for users possessing the `ADMIN` authority.
* Destructive actions (like the **Delete** or **Edit** buttons on customer profiles) are structurally hidden from non-administrative users.

### Standalone Components

The architecture exclusively utilizes Angular 17 **Standalone Components**. By completely removing traditional `NgModule` wrappers, the codebase is significantly simplified, and the application benefits from highly optimized lazy-loading and faster bootstrap times.

### Reactive Forms

Data collection and user input are managed entirely via **Reactive Forms**. This paradigm ensures robust, synchronous data validation that is completely decoupled from the HTML template, making the logic highly testable.

## Application Structure

### Authentication (`/login`)

* **Description:** Secure login form designed to authenticate credentials and securely store the returned JWT in the browser's local storage.

### Admin Dashboard (`/admin`)

* **Access:** Strictly reserved for Administrators.
* **Functions:** Global statistical visualization of the bank's operational health.

### Customers (`/customers`)

* **Functions:** Paginated list of clients, live search filtering, and management actions (CRUD).

### Accounts & Operations (`/accounts`)

* **Functions:** Direct account consultation, live balance rendering, and historical operation tracking.

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites (Fedora 43)

Ensure your local development environment is configured with the required Node runtime:

```bash
# Install Node.js and NPM
sudo dnf install nodejs npm

```

*Note: Ensure the Digital Banking Backend is actively running on port `8085` before launching the frontend.*

### 1. Install Dependencies

Clone the repository and install the required Angular packages:

```bash
npm install

```

### 2. Launch the Development Server

```bash
ng serve

```

The application will compile and be instantly accessible at `http://localhost:4200/`.
